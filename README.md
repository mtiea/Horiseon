NAME

       The Horiseon Website Project


PURPOSE
  
   My main purpose for the reconstruction of this website was to have viewers navigate easily and have no confusion what so ever.



DESCRIPTION

   Ive made changes to the Horiseon website to help visually impaired read through more effeciantly rather than having to squint at small text. Also, the website allows you to navigate easier as each subheading is divided within its clearly visible text box. This means you can click on the subheading at the top of the page then will navigate to its subheading and its description without any other subheadings in the picture.



INSTALLATION

   There are no installations required for this project. When you click on the live url, the page should refresh automatically to the Horiseon Webpage.
